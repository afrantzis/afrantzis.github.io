    <p>My fascination with computers started at a very young age.  Do you remember
when you were a kid and people asked you what you want be when you grow up?
Many people were surprised (or terrorized, can't be sure) to hear I wanted to
&quot;program computers&quot;. I guess they were expecting &quot;fireman&quot; or &quot;astronaut&quot;.</p>
<p>I wrote my first non-trivial program in primary school using GW-BASIC.  It was
a text adventure with a separate if statement for each instance of user input;
I hadn't discovered the concept of loops yet. I think I may have missed an
opportunity for a software patent here.  It took me some time, but I recovered
from the GW-BASIC experience and I am still sane enough to tell the story.</p>
<p>At about this time I started thinking about algorithms. I wanted to create a
program to play tic-tac-toe against me, and my young mind came up with surreal
ideas about the computer evaluating the board state by assigning numbers to
cells and adding them together. I confess that I still haven't abandonded my
childhood dream.</p>
<p>The next milestone was Turbo Pascal. With it I experienced the frustrat.., ahem,
<em>the joy</em>, of trying to program without any knowledge of the language or libraries,
and without any guide beyond the help file. I later realized that this was an
excellent preview of life as a software developer.</p>
<p>You can imagine my delight when I eventually convinced the compiler to build my
program and got my first executable file. I fervently copied the program to
floppies to give to my friends. This was the point of no return.</p>
