    <p>I have been looking for more information about the trends of the number of
confirmed COVID-19 cases per country. I could find the numbers for each day,
but I wanted a visual representation of the information in order to readily
compare the trends in various regions.</p>
<p>John Hopkins University (JHU) has set up a great
<a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">dashboard</a>
tracking the COVID-19 cases worldwide. It contains a time series graph of the
overall cases, but doesn't provide such graphs for each country.
Thankfully, JHU have made all their data publicly available (for
educational/academic purposes) in their <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">JHU CSSE COVID-19
repository</a>.</p>
<p>Since I couldn't find a visualization that matched my needs I decided
to create my own interactive graph:</p>
<p><a href="../../covid-19/">Interactive time series graph of confirmed COVID-19 cases per country</a></p>
<p>The graph is implemented as a web page that uses client-side processing (i.e.,
javascript) to plot the time series for one or more countries. The JHU
data is fetched and processed by the client on each page load, so the graph
will display the latest data without requiring any server-side updates.</p>
<p>For example, this is a plot from that page for France, Italy and Spain as of
2020-03-08:</p>
<p><img src="https://afrantzis.com/posts/covid-19-interactive-graph/france-italy-spain.png" alt="france-italy-spain" /></p>
<p>Given the time offset between the trend lines, it's not always clear how the
trends compare. To be able to compare trends more easily, I added an option to
synchronize the displayed time series so that they start at (approximately) the
same confirmed case count. Here is the same series as above but synchronized
at 200 cases:</p>
<p><img src="https://afrantzis.com/posts/covid-19-interactive-graph/france-italy-spain-sync-200.png" alt="france-italy-spain-sync-200" /></p>
<p>This plot indicates that France and Italy are following roughly the same trend,
whereas Spain is faring a bit better.</p>
<p>Before you draw any conclusions about trends that show up after
synchronization, keep in mind two important caveats.</p>
<p>First, since our sampling granularity is one day, and jumps in confirmed cases
between successive days can be large, starting points for each series after
synchronization may in fact be different enough to skew results. For example,
we may want to synchronize at around 200, but if one series jumps from 50 to
300, the starting point for that series is not going to be near 200.</p>
<p>Second, using different synchronization points may provide different views of
the trends. The same France-Italy-Spain plot synchronized at 40 cases gives:</p>
<p><img src="https://afrantzis.com/posts/covid-19-interactive-graph/france-italy-spain-sync-40.png" alt="france-italy-spain-sync-40" /></p>
<p>In this plot we can see that France and Spain initially followed a similar
trend, but then France started diverging upwards. This is somewhat apparent in
the original, non-synchronized plot, but only because the France and Spain
trend lines have a small time offset.</p>
<p>I hope people find this interactive graph informative!</p>
