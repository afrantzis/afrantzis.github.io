    <p>A few times in the recent past I've been in the unfortunate position of using a
prominent Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) program or library, and running
into issues of such fundamental nature that made me wonder how those issues
even made it into a release.</p>
<p>In all cases, the answer came quickly when I realized that, invariably, the
project involved either didn't have a test suite, or, if it did have one, it
was not adequately comprehensive.</p>
<p>I am using the term comprehensive in a very practical, non extreme way. I
understand that it's often not feasible to test every possible scenario and
interaction, but, at the very least, a decent test suite should ensure that
under typical circumstances the code delivers all the functionality it promises
to.</p>
<p>For projects of any value and significance, having such a comprehensive
automated test suite is nowadays considered a standard software engineering
practice. Why, then, don't we see more prominent, and certainly valuable, FOSS
projects employing this practice, or, when they do, why is it often employed
poorly? <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In this post I will highlight some of the reasons that I believe play a role in
the low adoption of proper automated testing in FOSS projects, and argue why
these reasons may be misguided. I will focus on topics that are especially
relevant from a FOSS perspective, omitting considerations, which, although
important, are not particular to FOSS.</p>
<p>My hope is that by shedding some light on this topic, more FOSS projects will
consider employing an automated test suite.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, I am a strong proponent of automating testing, but this
doesn't mean I consider it a silver bullet. I do believe, however, that it is
an indispensable tool in the software engineering toolbox, which should only be
forsaken after careful consideration.</p>
<h2 id="1-underestimating-the-cost-of-bugs">1. Underestimating the cost of bugs</h2>
<p>Most FOSS projects, at least those not supported by some commercial entity,
don't come with any warranty; it's even stated in the various licenses!  The
lack of any formal obligations makes it relatively inexpensive, both in terms
of time and money, to have the occasional bug in the codebase. This means that
there are fewer incentives for the developer to spend extra resources to try to
safeguard against bugs. When bugs come up, the developers can decide at their
own leisure if and when to fix them and when to release the fixed version.
Easy!</p>
<p>At first sight, this may seem like a reasonably pragmatic attitude to have.
After all, if fixing bugs is so cheap, is it worth spending extra resources
trying to prevent them?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, bugs are only cheap for the developer, not for the users who may
depend on the project for important tasks. Users expect the code to work
properly and can get frustrated or disappointed if this is not the case,
regardless of whether there is any formal warranty. This is even more
pronounced when security concerns are involved, for which the cost to users can
be devastating.</p>
<p>Of course, lack of formal obligations doesn't mean that there is no driver for
quality in FOSS projects. On the contrary, there is an exceptionally strong
driver: professional pride. In FOSS projects the developers are in the
spotlight and no (decent) developer wants to be associated with a low quality,
bug infested codebase. It's just that, due to the mentality stated above, in
many FOSS projects the trade-offs developers make seem to favor a reactive
rather than proactive attitude.</p>
<h2 id="2-overtrusting-code-reviews">2. Overtrusting code reviews</h2>
<p>One of the development practices FOSS projects employ ardently is code reviews.
Code reviews happen naturally in FOSS projects, even in small ones, since most
contributors don't have commit access to the code repository and the original
author has to approve any contributions. In larger projects there are often
more structured procedures which involve sending patches to a mailing list or
to a dedicated reviewing platform. Unfortunately, in some projects the trust on
code reviews is so great, that other practices, like automated testing, are
forsaken.</p>
<p>There is no question that code reviews are one of the best ways to maintain and
improve the quality of a codebase. They can help ensure that code is designed
properly, it is aligned with the overall architecture and furthers the long
term goals of the project. They also help catch bugs, but only some of them,
some of the time!</p>
<p>The main problem with code reviews is that we, the reviewers, are only human.
We humans are great at creative thought, but we are also great at overlooking
things, occasionally filling in the gaps with our own unicorns-and-rainbows
inspired reality. Another reason is that we tend to focus more on the code
changes at a local level, and less on how the code changes affect the system as
a whole.  This is not an inherent problem with the process itself but rather a
limitation of humans performing the process. When a codebase gets large enough,
it's difficult for our brains to keep all the possible states and code paths in
mind and check them mentally, even in a codebase that is properly designed.</p>
<p>In theory, the problem of human limitations is offset by the open nature of the
code.  We even have the so called Linus's law which states that &quot;given enough
eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&quot;. Note the clever use of the indeterminate term
&quot;enough&quot;. How many are enough? How about the qualitative aspects of the
&quot;eyeballs&quot;? </p>
<p>The reality is that most contributions to big, successful FOSS projects are
reviewed on average by a couple of people. Some projects are better, most are
worse, but in no case does being FOSS magically lead to a large number of
reviewers tirelessly checking code contributions. This limit in the number of
reviewers also limits the extent to which code reviews can stand as the only
process to ensure quality.</p>
<h2 id="3-it-s-not-in-the-culture">3. It's not in the culture</h2>
<p>In order to try out a development process in a project, developers first need
to learn about it and be convinced that it will be beneficial. Although there
are many resources, like books and articles, arguing in favor of automated
tests, the main driver for trying new processes is still learning about them
from more experienced developers when working on a project. In the FOSS world
this also takes the form of studying what other projects, especially the
high-profile ones, are doing.</p>
<p>Since comprehensive automated testing is not the norm in FOSS, this creates a
negative network effect. Why should you bother doing automated tests if the
high profile projects, which you consider to be role models, don't do it
properly or at all?</p>
<p>Thankfully, the culture is beginning to shift, especially in projects using
technologies in which automated testing is part of the culture of the
technologies themselves. Unfortunately, many of the system-level and middleware
FOSS projects are still living in the non automated test world.</p>
<h2 id="4-tests-as-an-afterthought">4. Tests as an afterthought</h2>
<p>Tests as an afterthought is not a situation particular to FOSS projects, but it
is especially relevant to them since the way they spring and grow can
disincentivize the early writing of tests.</p>
<p>Some FOSS projects start as small projects to scratch an itch, without any
plans for significant growth or adoption, so the incentives to have tests at
this stage are limited.</p>
<p>In addition, many projects, even the ones that start with more lofty adoption
goals, follow a &quot;release early, release often&quot; mentality. This mentality has
some benefits, but at the early stages also carries the risk of placing the
focus exclusively on making the project as relevant to the public as possible,
as quickly as possible. From such a perspective, spending the probably limited
resources on tests instead of features seems like a bad use of developer time.</p>
<p>As the project grows and becomes more complex, however, more and more
opportunities for bugs arise. At this point, some projects realize that adding
a test suite would be beneficial for maintaining quality in the long term.
Unfortunately, for many projects, it's already too late. The code by now has
become test-unfriendly and significant effort is needed to change it.</p>
<p>The final effect is that many projects remain without an automated test suite,
or, in the best case, with a poor one.</p>
<h2 id="5-missing-ci-infrastructure">5. Missing CI infrastructure</h2>
<p>Automated testing delivers the most value if it is combined with a CI service
that runs the tests automatically for each commit or merge proposal. Until
recently, access to such services was difficult to get for a reasonably low
effort and cost. Developers either had to set up and host CI themselves, or pay
for a commercial service, thus requiring resources which unsponsored FOSS
projects were unlikely to be able to afford.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it's far easier to find and use free CI services, with most major
code hosting platforms supporting them. Hopefully, with time, this reason will
completely cease being a factor in the lack of automated testing adoption.</p>
<h2 id="6-not-the-hacker-way">6. Not the hacker way</h2>
<p>The FOSS movement originated from the hacker culture and still has strong ties
to it. In the minds of some, the processes around software testing are too
enterprise-y, too 9-to-5, perceived as completely contrary to the creative and
playful nature of hacking. </p>
<p>My argument against this line of thought is that the hacker values technical
excellence very highly, and, automated testing, as a tool that helps achieve
such excellence, can not be inconsistent with the hacker way.</p>
<p>Some pseudo-hackers may also argue that their skills are so refined that their
code doesn't require testing. When we are talking about a codebase of any
significant size, I consider this attitude to be a sign of inexperience and
immaturity rather than a testament of superior skills.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>I hope this post will serve as a good starting point for a discussion about the
reasons which discourage FOSS projects from adopting a comprehensive automated
test suite. Identifying both valid concerns and misconceptions is the first
step in convincing both fledging and mature FOSS projects to embrace automated
testing, which will hopefully lead to an improvement in the overall quality of
FOSS.</p>
