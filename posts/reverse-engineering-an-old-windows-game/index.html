    <p>A few months ago I decided to revisit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Express">The Last
Express</a>, one of the most
unique adventure games of the 1990s. Since the version I have (from 1997)
provided a Windows executable, I decided to run it using the Wayland driver for
Wine. Eager to treat myself to a nostalgic journey, I ran the game and saw...
nothing! I could hear the ominous menu music, but all I got was a minimized
window which completely ignored my attempts at restoration. I tried the game
with the Wine X11 driver and it worked as expected.</p>
<p>Disappointed, but also determined to get this working with the Wayland driver, I
ran the game with Wine debug logging turned on. The strange minimization
behavior led me to turn my attention to the <code>SetWindowPos</code> and <code>ShowWindow</code>
calls, hoping that I would get some insight about what was affecting the window
state. Here is what I got for the game start up, with some additional comments:</p>

<p>It seemed that some logic was forcing the window to always become minimized.
After briefly exploring the possibility of the Wayland driver or Wine core doing
something fancy, I reached the conclusion that the minimization logic lived in
the application itself.</p>
<p>Why did the application minimize itself when running with the Wayland driver? A
mystery befitting the theme of the game itself!</p>
<p>In order to gain more insights, I had to take a peek into the inner workings
of the game. I loaded the <code>_le.exe</code> executable in Ghidra, analyzed it with
the default options and I searched for symbols references to <code>ShowWindow</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://afrantzis.com/posts/reverse-engineering-an-old-windows-game/ghidra-le-symrefs.png" alt="ghidra-le-symrefs.png" /></p>
<p>The first entry was for the location within the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#import-address-table">Import Address Table
(IAT)</a>
which the dynamic linker will fill in with the address of the
<code>CWnd::ShowWindow</code> function from <code>MFC42.DLL</code>.</p>
<p>The second entry was the <code>CWnd::ShowWindow</code> thunk function within <code>_le.exe</code>,
which transfers control to the real <code>CWnd::ShowWindow</code> function by using
the address from the IAT location described above:</p>

<p>This import immediately provided a hint that the game was using Microsoft
Foundation Classes, i.e., object-oriented wrappers around the Win32 API, and as
such I should be on the lookout for standard object-oriented patterns.</p>
<p>The thunk function is what the application actually calls internally, and in
the list above I could see several references to it. Alas, I checked the code
at each reference location, but none was passing <code>6</code> (<code>SW_MINIMIZE</code>) as the
show command. Could there be other references to the <code>CWnd::ShowWindow</code> thunk
that Ghidra was missing?</p>
<p>I decided to get a second opinion from <code>radare2</code>:</p>

<p>There were indeed more references to the <code>CWnd::ShowWindow</code> thunk. I noted
that the references Ghidra was missing didn't belong to any known function
(<code>(nofunc)</code> in radare2), and that was the reason they weren't detected by
default. The solution was to rerun Ghidra's analysis with the &quot;Aggressive
Instruction Finder&quot; option turned on, which gave me the following references:</p>
<p><img src="https://afrantzis.com/posts/reverse-engineering-an-old-windows-game/ghidra-le-symrefs-aggresive.png" alt="ghidra-le-symrefs-aggresive.png" /></p>
<p>Note that the <code>0x45a37e</code> reference was still missing from Ghidra. I was able to
to add it by manually marking the region as code (in fact the relevant function
seems to start at <code>0x45a340</code>). In the end it didn't matter, though, since that
particular invocation was using the <code>9 (SW_RESTORE)</code> command, so was not
relevant for our investigation.</p>
<p>From the updated reference list above there were two that involved a
minimization command, at <code>0x45af0e</code> and <code>0x45afa7</code>. The function at <code>0x45ae10</code>
which contained the <code>0x45af0e</code> reference was decompiled by Ghidra as:</p>
<p><img src="https://afrantzis.com/posts/reverse-engineering-an-old-windows-game/ghidra-le-decompile-45ae10.png" alt="ghidra-le-decompile-45ae10.png" /></p>
<p>Although the high-level flow of this function was clear enough, I must say I
didn't become more enlightened about the condition(s) that could lead to
minimization. A quick look at some of the invoked functions indicated that a
deeper investigation was required to understand how all this works, so I
decided to move to the next function and revisit later, if needed.</p>
<p>The second reference <code>0x45afa7</code> was part of the of the <code>0x45af70</code> function:</p>
<p><img src="https://afrantzis.com/posts/reverse-engineering-an-old-windows-game/ghidra-le-decompile-45af70.png" alt="ghidra-le-decompile-45af70.png" /></p>
<p>This was more promising, with a very clear check affecting minimization at
the start of the function! As I could see from the decompiler output, the first
argument was effectively a <code>CWnd *</code>. The unconditional call to
<code>CWnd::OnDisplayChange</code> at the end allowed me to reasonably (and ultimately
correctly) assume that this function was in fact an override of the
<code>OnDisplayChange</code> method for a custom class inheriting from <code>CWnd</code>, so I
named this function <code>LExpressCWnd::OnDisplayChange</code>.</p>
<p>The documentation for <code>CWnd::OnDisplayChange</code> was (and still is) surprisingly
scarce online, but in a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/visual-cpp-change-history-2003-2015">Microsoft C/C++
changelog</a>
I found the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CWnd::OnDisplayChange changed to (UINT, int, int) instead of (WPARAM, LPARAM)
so that the new ON_WM_DISPLAYCHANGE macro can be used in the message map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the game predated these changes, I determined that <code>param_1</code>
and <code>param_2</code> were really <code>wparam</code> and <code>lparam</code> of the corresponding
<code>WM_DISPLAYCHANGE</code> message. From the <code>WM_DISPLAYCHANGE</code>
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdi/wm-displaychange">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>wParam</em><br />
The new image depth of the display, in bits per pixel.<br />
<em>lParam</em><br />
The low-order word specifies the horizontal resolution of the screen.<br />
The high-order word specifies the vertical resolution of the screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pieces of the puzzle finally started to fall into place! Taking into
account the new information I updated the decompiled source like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://afrantzis.com/posts/reverse-engineering-an-old-windows-game/ghidra-le-decompile-45af70-16bpp.png" alt="ghidra-le-decompile-45af70-16bpp.png" /></p>
<p>There was a lot missing still, but the main takeway, in the highlighted part of
the code above, was that if the display mode was changed to one that did not
use 16 bits per pixel, the application unceremoniously minimized itself!</p>
<p>Indeed, in that older version of the Wayland driver for Wine we were choosing a
32-bit mode regardless of what the application specified. This worked for most
DirectX games since Wine internally deals with the inconsistency. However, <em>The
Last Express</em> explicitly checks the bits per pixel value sent with the
<code>WM_DISPLAYCHANGE</code> message and our ploy is exposed!</p>
<p>I updated the Wayland driver to properly set the <code>WM_DISPLAYCHANGE</code> bits per
pixel parameter, and verified that this fixed the minimization problem. I was
finally able to continue my (train) trip down memory lane!</p>

<p>Although this partial analysis was enough to allow me to resolve the task at
hand, I remained curious about some of the details of display configuration and
the unexplained aspects of the <code>LExpressCWnd::OnDisplayChange</code> function. To
explore further, I tracked symbol references to the <code>ChangeDisplaySettingsA</code>
function from <code>USER32.DLL</code> and came across two invocations in <code>_le.exe</code>. I will
spare you the details, but one reference was from a function that I determined
configured the display mode for the game (which I named
<code>LExpressCWnd::ConfigureDisplay</code> at <code>0x45ba20</code>), and the other from a function
that restored the original mode (<code>LExpressCwnd::RestoreDisplay</code> at <code>0x45bbd0</code>).
One interesting point about these invocations was that the code was tracking
the kind of display configuration operation the game was performing, by using
fields in <code>LExpressCWnd</code>. For example, in <code>LExpressCWnd::ConfigureDisplay</code>
there was the following decompiled snippet (after giving some more descriptive
names):</p>

<p>The <code>LExpressCWnd::configuring_display</code> field and the corresponding
<code>LExpressCWnd::restoring_display</code> used in <code>LExpressCWnd::RestoreDisplay</code>, were
two of the mysterious fields used in <code>LExpressCWnd::OnDisplayChange</code>. The idea
is that <code>ChangeDisplaySettingsA</code> sends the <code>WM_DISPLAYCHANGE</code> message
synchronously, and thus <code>LExpressCWnd::OnDisplayChange</code> is called in the
context of that invocation, reading the values of these fields.</p>
<p>With all this new information and a lot of additional exploration in the
executable, I reached this more complete version of
<code>LExpressCWnd::OnDisplayChange</code>:</p>

<p>Fortuitously, the discovery of the
<code>LExpressCWnd::ConfigureDisplay/RestoreDisplay</code> functions also helped to shed
some light on the mysterious function at <code>0x45ae10</code> which we encountered
earlier in this post. My best guess about that function was that it handles the
(de)activation of the game window, so I named it <code>LExpressCWnd::OnActivate</code>. On
activation it increases the game thread priority and configures the display
mode (if in fullscreen mode). On deactivation it sets the game thread priority
to normal, restores the display mode and minimizes the window. My final
decompilation looks like:</p>
