    <p>I have been an adherent of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style">bottom-posting</a>, or, to be more
precise, of interleaved-posting for as long as I can remember. I don't recall
why I selected this posting style when first I started sending emails — I guess
it just felt more intuitive and natural.</p>
<p>These days I find top-posted messages so annoying to deal with, that I manually
convert them to bottom-posted before replying. Unfortunately, many modern email
clients and web interfaces promote a top-posting style, so I end up performing
such conversions more often than I would like. A few weeks ago I received an 8
level deep top-posted email and decided that it is time for me to welcome our
automated email conversion overlords. The result is the
<a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/top2bottom">top2bottom</a> command-line tool.</p>
<p>There are many forms of top-posting, but the one I have to deal with the most,
and therefore the one that the top2bottom tool handles, looks like:</p>

<p>The number of quote-prefix markers (&gt;) in the beginning of each line indicates
the <strong>quote-depth</strong> of that line.</p>
<p>This form consists of two kinds of line blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>attribution blocks</strong>, denoted by <strong>aD</strong>, where D is the quote-depth of the block</li>
<li><strong>body blocks</strong>, denoted by <strong>bD</strong>, where D is the quote-depth of the block</li>
</ul>
<p>In a top-posted message the blocks are interleaved:</p>
<p>b0, a0, b1, a1, b2, a2, ...</p>
<p>To convert such a message to bottom-posted we need to move all attribution
blocks to the top in quote-depth order, followed by all body blocks in reverse
quote-depth order:</p>
<p>a0, a1, a2, ..., b2, b1, b0</p>
<p>The block reordering operation can be easily implemented by sorting with an
appropriate comparison function. The more interesting and non-trivial part is
figuring out which lines belong to which block. To do this, we first need to
define some terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An <strong>empty line</strong> is a line that has no message content, although it may
have one or more quote-prefix markers (&gt;), i.e., a non-zero quote-depth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>paragraph</strong> is a sequence of non-empty, consecutive lines of the same
quote-depth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can provide precise definitions for attribution and body blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An attribution block of quote-depth D is the sequence of all consecutive
lines of quote-depth D which start from the beginning of the last
paragraph before a quote-depth increase from D to D+1, and end at the
last line before the quote-depth increase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A body block of quote-depth D is the sequence of all lines (not
necessarily consecutive) of quote-depth D that do not belong to an
attribution block.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these definitions, I experimented with a number of  classification
algorithms. For my first attempt I used a chain of functional operations to
process the message, but I found it unintuitive to express the intricacies of
block detection in this manner. My next attempt was based on a finite state
machine and performed a single pass of the message from bottom to top. The
finite state machine approach worked, but it was more complex and difficult to
reason about than I would like. Finally, I developed an algorithm that I found
to be both simpler and more obviously correct than the alternatives.</p>
<p>The algorithm works by processing lines from top to bottom, marking them as
body lines of their respective quote-depth. When a quote-depth increase is
detected, and before processing the line with the increased quote-depth, the
algorithm backtracks until it reaches the beginning of a paragraph, marking all
lines it visits as attribution lines. It then continues processing from the
point it stopped before backtracking.</p>
<p>The empty line (if any) just before an attribution block needs special care. It
is an artifact of top-posting and serves to separate the preceding message body
from the attribution lines. In top2bottom I opted to repurpose this line as an
extra space after a quote-depth change in the bottom-posted output. This works
well because top-posted replies usually don't start with an empty line, so
adding this line makes the bottom-posted version look better. In algorithmic
terms, this line is marked as belonging to a special <strong>before-body block</strong> (denoted
by <strong>bD-</strong>), which is placed just before the <strong>bD</strong> block in the final output.</p>
<p>Here is the algorithm in action:</p>
<p><img src="https://afrantzis.com/posts/converting-emails-from-top-posted-to-bottom-posted/top2bottom-algorithm.gif" alt="top2bottom-algorithm" /></p>
<p>The algorithm works well if the input is top-posted, but what happens if the
input has some other form? It turns out that the algorithm works well for two
additional classes of messages that are not strictly top-posted and are often
encountered in the wild. The first class consists of messages that end with a
cascade of empty lines of decreasing quote-depth, which is a result of
(inadvertently) adding empty lines to the end of a message when replying. The
example used above to show the algorithm in action actually belongs to this
class. The second class comprises messages that started as (strictly)
bottom-posted, but for which the replies changed to top-posted at some point.</p>
<p>There is, however, a third class of messages that is also frequently seen, but
the  algorithm I described so far cannot handle without some enhancements. This
class is composed of messages that started as interleaved-posted and then
turned to top-posted. To handle this class we need a way to detect the section
of the message that is interleaved-posted and ensure that we don't reorder its
parts, but rather treat it as an indivisible whole.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is an easy way to decide which lines of the message belong
to the interleaved section. The quote-depth curve of interleaved messages has a
characteristic pattern of multiple peaks (lines with the highest quote-depth
locally) and valleys (lines with lower quote-depths between successive peaks).
In a deeply interleaved message the base quote-depth of the interleaved section
is the quote-depth of the lowest valley. All lines with quote-depth equal to or
higher than the base quote-depth belong to the interleaved section of the
message. In the following example, the lowest (and only) valley has a
quote-depth of 2, so we treat the marked part of the message, which consists of
all lines with quote-depth 2 or more, as indivisible:</p>

<p>The latest version of top2bottom implements the aforementioned enhancement,
and, with it, can handle almost all of the top-posted messages of this form
that I have encountered. The few messages which top2bottom refuses to convert
are either badly formatted or use a different form of top-posting.</p>
<p>I have been using top2bottom for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with it.
I am using Vim for composing and replying to emails, so my preferred way to
convert emails is by using the Vim filter command: :%!top2bottom. I hope you
find top2bottom useful!</p>
<p>A closing note: while doing some research for this post I came across another,
much older program that also performs top to bottom email conversion, and
which, unsurprisingly, is also named top2bottom. The code for it was posted in
an old Red Hat list
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-list/2006-October/msg01391.html">post</a>. I
have tried it on a few sample top-posted emails, but it doesn't seem to work
well, at least not for the kinds of emails that I get. YMMV.</p>
