    <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Several years ago I was working on <a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/libbls">libbls</a>, a library implementing
editable buffers that can efficiently hold contents originating from both
memory and file sources. Typical clients of this libraries are programs that
need to edit arbitrary portions of very large files, like hex editors or wave
editors, while minimizing the required memory usage.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting problems I encountered was devising an efficient
way to save buffers to their corresponding files in place, while minimizing the
extra memory (or disk space) used in the process. This post describes how this
problem, which turns out to be NP-hard, can be modeled as a graph, and how we
can provide a reasonable solution by using a variation of a standard graph
algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Buffers in libbls are described in terms of segments that contain data from
either memory or file sources. In order to conserve memory (and sometimes to
even make the editing feasible) the data from file sources is not loaded into
main memory. Instead, the buffer keeps information about the contained files
and ranges and reads the data in vm-page-sized chunks when needed. So, a buffer
could look like:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">B:  |F1:0-9   |M1:10-18|F1:10-19 |M2:10-19|F2:0-6|
</span></code></pre>
<p>Where F1 and F2 are file sources, M1 and M2 are memory sources and S:B-E
denotes a segment representing bytes from the range [B, E] of source S.</p>
<p>In the simple case, saving a buffer to a file consists of just reading data
from the various sources and writing them out to the target file. Things become
more complicated when the target file happens to be one of the file sources
used in the buffer.</p>
<p>This post aims to illustrate the issues that can arise in such cases and
propose an elegant way to resolve them.</p>
<h2 id="illustrating-the-problem">Illustrating the problem</h2>
<p>Saving the buffer to a file typically involves reading each segment in order
and writing it out to the file. However, if the segment source is the same as
the file that we are writing to, and depending on the ordering of segments, we
may face a serious problem.</p>
<p>To illustrate the problem, consider a buffer B containing segment [0-9] of file
F at range [10-19] of the buffer, and assume that we want to write the buffer
back to file F:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">    S
F:  |0-9      |.........|

              S             
B:  |.........|F:0-9    |
    ^         ^         ^
    0         10        20
</span></code></pre>
<p>Writing the buffer segments in order leads to a situation where we first write
out buffer range [0-9] to file F, overwriting the contents of the file at that
range. So, when moving on to the next segment, trying to write out the range
[10-19] of the buffer, the data we are going to read from the file (and
therefore write) is not the original data of [F:0-9], but the data belonging to
the previous segment of the buffer we just wrote at positions [0-9].</p>
<p>The solution in this case is to first write out range [10-19] of the buffer to
the file, so that the data we use is the original file data, and only then
write out any other segments.</p>
<p>The problem can become even more complicated when we have more segments from
the target file. A particularly interesting case arises when a segment from the
buffer which belongs to the target file happens to overlap with another segment
of F which is also present in the buffer:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">    S                   T
F:  |0-9      |.........|20-29    |.........|
                      
            T                     S 
B:  |.......|F:20-29  |...........|F:0-9    |
    ^       ^         ^           ^
    0       8         18          30
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case segment S in F overlaps with segment T in B. We can simply try to
adapt the strategy used in the previous case and first write out the two target
file segments. This works but only if we are extra careful.  In this case, if
we first write segment T then when we try to read the data of segment S we will
read wrong data (file range 8-9 will contain data from segment T). If we do it
the other way around everything works wonderfully. </p>
<p>Taking the last example one step further, consider what happens if we have
cyclic overlaps:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">    S                   T
F:  |0-9      |.........|20-29    |....|

            T                S 
B:  |.......|F:20-29  |......|F:0-9    |
    ^       ^         ^      ^     ^
    0       8         18     25    30
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now segment S in F overlaps with segment T in B, and segment T in F overlaps
with segment S in B. In this case there is no way to order the writes of
segments S and T so that we end up with the correct data.</p>
<p>A straightforward but wasteful way of tackling this problem is to save the
whole buffer to a temporary file and then move the file to its final location.
This works, and in some cases is preferred since it has the benefit of
atomicity, but requires extra space for the temporary file. When buffers reach
many GiB in size this method may prove to be unfeasible.</p>
<p><a name="remove-overlap"></a></p>
<p>A more efficient method is to try to eliminate the cyclic overlaps by removing
at least one of the overlaps involved. In the previous case we can replace
segment T in B with two segments M and T1 so that no overlap occurs. Segment M
will contain a part of T's data but will actually store them in memory (or a
temporary file if necessary) and the T1 segment will just be a T minus the
range stored in M. This approach still requires some amount of extra memory,
but in most cases this amount is much smaller than the size of the whole
buffer. Using this scheme we have:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">    S                     T1
F:  |0-9      |...........|22-29  |....|

            M T1              S 
B:  |.......|.|F:22-29|......|F:0-9    |
    ^       ^         ^      ^     ^
    0       8         18     25    30
</span></code></pre>
<p>We have managed to eliminate the first overlap and now we can safely save the
buffer by first writing T1 then S and then the remaining segments of B.</p>
<h2 id="modeling-the-problem">Modeling the problem</h2>
<p>The examples presented in the previous section show representative but simple
cases of the problems we can run into. In order to be able to handle cases of
arbitrary complexity it is useful to create a model of the problem. We can then
use this model to come up with algorithms that provide generic solutions.</p>
<p>The model we are going to present uses graphs. In these <em>overlap graphs</em>
vertices represent segments from the file we are going to save to, that are
also present in the buffer we are going to save. Edges between vertices denote
segment overlap: an edge from vertex P to vertex Q denotes that segment P in
the target file overlaps with segment Q in the buffer. Every edge carries with
it the size of the overlapping range.</p>
<p>Here are some buffers and their respective overlap graphs (P* denotes a
self-loop on P):</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">    P              Q                   R
F:  |0-9      |....|15-24    |.........|35-42  |

                             P
B1: |........................|F:0-9    |.......|   P

              P              Q
B2: |.........|F:0-9     |...|F:15-24  |.......|   Q --&gt; P

         P                Q
B3: |....|F:0-9    |......|F:20-29  |..........|   P* Q*

    R        P                    Q
B4: |F:35-42|F:0-9    |...........|F:20-29  |..|   R &lt;-- P* &lt;-- Q
                                                    \___________^

</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="solving-the-problem">Solving the problem</h2>
<p>Using the overlap graph we can now answer the question: in what order should
the vertices (segments) be written to the file so that the correct data is
written?</p>
<p>If the graph has no cycles then we can process the vertices in topological
order. Topological order guarantees that each vertex is processed only when its
dependencies have already been processed and written to file, and thus that no
unwritten file segment in the buffer overlaps with the destination range of
that vertex.</p>
<p>As a special case, we can process a vertex that has a self-loop but no other
incoming edge.  This is achieved by first writing to the file the
non-overlapping part of the vertex and then the rest.</p>
<p>In order to handle graphs with cycles (except self-loops) we must find a way to
break the cycles. This can be achieved by removing the correct edges. An edge
from P to Q can be removed by replacing Q in the buffer by the segments Q1 and
M as described <a href="https://afrantzis.com/posts/efficient-saving-of-multi-source-buffers/#remove-overlap">previously</a>. M contains an in memory copy of
data of the overlapping range. Q1 is the part of Q that remains. This technique
eliminates the overlap (because the overlapping part is now stored in memory)
and removes the edge. By choosing the edges to remove wisely, we can minimize
the amount of extra memory we are going to need.</p>
<p>Once we have an acyclic graph (self-loops allowed) we can process it as
described previously.</p>
<p>Let's manually apply this method to an example:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">    P              Q                   R
F:  |0-9      |....|15-24    |.........|35-42  |

    R        P                    Q
B4: |F:35-42|F:0-9    |...........|F:20-29  |..|   R &lt;-- P* &lt;-- Q
                                                    \___________^
</span></code></pre>
<p>We first have to make the graph acyclic. We have a few choices for which edge
to break:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q-&gt;P, a 3 byte overlap</li>
<li>P-&gt;R, a 7 byte overlap</li>
<li>R-&gt;Q, a 5 byte overlap</li>
</ul>
<p>To minimize the required extra memory we break the Q-&gt;P edge by storing the
last three bytes of P in memory as segment M, so we get:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">    P1             Q                   R
F:  |0-6   |.......|15-24    |.........|35-42  |

    R       P1     M              Q
B4: |F:35-42|F:0-6 |..|...........|F:20-29  |..|   Q &lt;-- R &lt;-- P1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that coincidentally we also resolved the self-loop of P. Now that we have
an acyclic graph we can process the buffer segments in topological order, thus
we first store P1 in range [8-14] of the file, next is R at [0-7] and finally Q
at range [30-40] followed by all other portions of the buffer.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h2>
<p>libbls implements the solution described above when saving a file in place. The
high level logic for the algorithm resides in
<a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/libbls/blob/17ade9439adbf2d46ed0d2a04dc9819563df38c5/src/buffer_file.c#L610">bless_buffer_save</a>. The implementation of the algorithm
within that function can be conceptually split into three steps. Some
implementation details for each step are given below, along with links to the
functions that provide the relevant functionality.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-creating-the-overlap-graph">Step 1: Creating the overlap graph</h4>
<p>Relevant functions:</p>
<p><strong>buffer_file.c</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/libbls/blob/17ade9439adbf2d46ed0d2a04dc9819563df38c5/src/buffer_file.c#L134">create_overlap_graph</a><br />
<strong>overlap_graph.c</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/libbls/blob/17ade9439adbf2d46ed0d2a04dc9819563df38c5/src/overlap_graph.c#L291">overlap_graph_add_segment</a></p>
<p>To create the overlap graph we have to scan the buffer segment collection for
segments that belong to the file we want to save to. Each new segment that is
found must be checked against all previous found file segments for overlap.
This is an <em>O(n + k*f(k))</em> algorithm where n is the number of segments in the
segment collection and <em>k</em> the number of segments belonging to the file.  If we
check for overlap naively then <em>f(k) = O(k)</em> and therefore the algorithm is
<em>O(n + k*k)</em>. We can use an interval tree so that <em>f(k) = O(logk)</em> and the
algorithm becomes <em>O(n + k*logk)</em>.  As we don't expect <em>k</em> to grow too large,
the implementation currently uses the naive approach for simplicity.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-making-the-graph-acyclic">Step 2: Making the graph acyclic</h4>
<p>Relevant functions:</p>
<p><strong>overlap_graph.c</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/libbls/blob/17ade9439adbf2d46ed0d2a04dc9819563df38c5/src/overlap_graph.c#L377">overlap_graph_remove_cycles</a></p>
<p>In the second step the goal is to remove cycles from the graph, while trying to
minimize the total weight of the removed edges in order to minimize extra
memory usage. However, it turns out that the problem we are trying to solve,
minimum feedback arc set, is NP-Hard! Don't despair though; we can get
reasonable results with only little extra work.</p>
<p>The undirected counterpart of the minimum feedback arc set problem is the
minimum (or maximum) spanning tree (MST) problem, which can be efficiently
solved by using various methods. We can use these methods to give a solution
(but not the best) for our problem, too. We can do that because MST algorithms
remove all undirected cycles and therefore all directed ones, too. The caveat
is that they remove more that we need them to; undirected cycles that are not
directed.</p>
<p>MST algorithms work by processing edges in non-decreasing or non-increasing
order of weight and adding them to the already formed tree (Prim) or trees
(Kruskal) if they aren't already connected to them by an undirected path.
Because our goal is to avoid directed cycles we can be more lax with the rules
of adding an edge. A simple but useful observation is that if the destination
node of an edge has no outgoing edges then a directed cycle cannot be formed,
regardless of whether there is a pre-existing undirected path between the two
nodes. Similarly, if the source node of an edge has no incoming edges a
directed cycle cannot be formed either, regardless of the pre-existence of an
undirected path between the source and destination nodes.</p>
<p>We can use the previous observations to decrease the number of edges that are
incorrectly deleted by the MST algorithms when acting on directed graphs.
Although we don't completely eliminate the erroneous deletions, these rules
give reasonable results while keeping the complexity the same as in the
undirected case.</p>
<p>Of the MST algorithms, Kruskal's algorithm can be used unchanged in directed
graphs because it works directly on edges and doesn't care about their
direction. It also works on disconnected graphs, since it finds a spanning
forest. For these reasons, it was selected as the basis for the algorithm used
by libbls.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-removing-edges-and-saving-to-file">Step 3: Removing edges and saving to file</h4>
<p>Relevant functions:</p>
<p><strong>overlap_graph.c</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/libbls/blob/17ade9439adbf2d46ed0d2a04dc9819563df38c5/src/overlap_graph.c#L544">overlap_graph_get_removed_edges</a><br />

<p>In the previous step we calculated which edges would need to be removed to
create an acyclic graph. In this step we first perform the actual removal of
these edges by storing the associated data in memory or a temporary file as
described <a href="https://afrantzis.com/posts/efficient-saving-of-multi-source-buffers/#remove-overlap">previously</a>.</p>
<p>Removing the edges has the unfortunate side effect of further altering the
graph as segments are removed, added or changed in the segment collection. This
means that after removing the edges we must re-calculate the overlap graph for
the segment collection.  There may be some way to avoid re-calculating the
whole graph, making only local changes to the existing graph as vertices are
altered but we will use the simple (although more costly) way for now.</p>
<p>We then use this new overlap graph, which is guaranteed not to have any cycles,
to get the vertices in topological order and save them to the target file.</p>
