    <p>Ever since <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/">Vulkan</a> was announced a few years
ago, the idea of creating a Vulkan benchmarking tool in the spirit of
<a href="https://github.com/glmark2/glmark2">glmark2</a> had been floating in my mind.
Recently, thanks to my employer, <a href="https://www.collabora.com/">Collabora</a>, this
idea has materialized! The result is the vkmark Vulkan benchmark, hosted on
github:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vkmark/vkmark">https://github.com/vkmark/vkmark</a></p>
<p>Like its glmark2 sibling project, vkmark's goals are different from the goals
of big, monolithic and usually proprietary benchmarks. Instead of providing a
single, complex benchmark, vkmark aims to provide an extensible suite of
targeted, configurable benchmarking scenes. Most scenes exercise specific
Vulkan features or usage patterns (e.g., desktop 2.5D scenarios), although we
are also happy to have more complex, visually intriguing scenes.</p>
<p>Benchmarking scenes can be configured with options that affect various aspects
of their rendering. We hope that the ease with which developers can use
different options will make it painless to perform targeted tests and
eventually provide best practices advice.</p>
<p>A few years ago we were pleasantly surprised to learn that developers were
using glmark2 as a testing tool for driver development, especially in free (as
in freedom) software projects. This is a goal that we want to actively pursue
for vkmark, too. The flexible benchmarking approach is a natural fit for this
kind of development; the developer can start with getting the simple scenes
working and then, as the driver matures, move to scenes that use more advanced
features. vkmark has already proved useful in this regard, being an valuable
testing aid for my own experiments in the Mesa Vulkan WSI implementation.</p>
<p>With vkmark we also want to be on the cutting edge of software development
practices and tools. vkmark is a modern, C++14 codebase, using the
<a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp">vulkan-hpp</a> bindings, the
<a href="http://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a> build system and the
<a href="https://github.com/philsquared/Catch">Catch</a> test framework. To ensure a high
quality codebase, the core of vkmark is developed using test-driven
development.</p>
<p>It is still early days, but vkmark already has support for X11, Wayland and
DRM/KMS, and provides two simple scenes: a &quot;clear&quot; scene, and a &quot;cube&quot; scene
that renders a simple colored cube based on the
<a href="https://github.com/krh/vkcube">vkcube</a> example (which is itself based on
<a href="https://github.com/robclark/kmscube">kmscube</a>). The future looks bright!</p>
<p>We are looking forward to getting more feedback on vkmark and, of course,
contributions are always welcome!</p>
