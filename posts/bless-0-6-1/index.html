    <p>A long time ago, on a computer far, far away... well, actually, 14 years ago,
on a computer that is still around somewhere in the basement, I wrote the first
lines of source code for what would become the Bless hex editor.</p>
<p>For my initial experiments I used C++ with the gtkmm bindings, but C++
compilation times were so appallingly slow on my feeble computer, that I
decided to give the relatively young <a href="https://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a>
framework a try. The development experience was much better, so I continued
with Mono and Gtk#. For revision control, I started out with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_arch">tla</a> (remember that?), but eventually
settled on bzr.</p>
<p>Development continued at a steady pace until 2009, when life's responsibilities
got in the way, and left me with little time to work on the project. A few
attempts were made by other people to revive Bless after that, but,
unfortunately, they also seem to have stagnated.  The project had been inactive
for almost 8 years when the gna.org hosting site closed down in 2017 and pulled
the official Bless page and bzr repository with it into the abyss. </p>
<p>Despite the lack of development and maintenance, Bless remained surprisingly
functional through the years. I, and many others it seems, have kept using it,
and, naturally, a few bugs have been uncovered during this time.</p>
<p>I recently found some time to bring the project back to life, although, I
should warn, this does not imply any intention to resume feature development on
it. My free time is still scarce, so the best I can do is try to maintain it
and accept contributions. The project's new official home is at
<a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/bless">https://github.com/afrantzis/bless</a>.</p>
<p>To mark the start of this new era, I have released <a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/bless/releases">Bless
0.6.1</a>, containing fixes for many
of the major issues I could find reports for. Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: There seems to be a bug in some versions of Mono that
manifests as a crash when selecting bytes. The backtrace looks like:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">free(): invalid pointer
Stacktrace:

  at &lt;unknown&gt; &lt;0xffffffff&gt;
  at (wrapper managed-to-native) GLib.SList.g_free (intptr) &lt;0x0005f&gt;
  at GLib.ListBase.Empty () &lt;0x0013c&gt;
  at GLib.ListBase.Dispose (bool) &lt;0x0000f&gt;
  at GLib.ListBase.Finalize () &lt;0x0001d&gt;
  at (wrapper runtime-invoke) object.runtime_invoke_virtual_void__this__ (object,intptr,intptr,intptr) &lt;0x00068&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Searching for this backtrace you can find various reports of other Mono
programs also affected by this bug. At the time of writing, the mono packages
in Debian and Ubuntu (4.6.2) exhibit this problem. If you are affected, the
solution is to update to a newer version of Mono, e.g., from
<a href="https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/">https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/</a>.</p>
