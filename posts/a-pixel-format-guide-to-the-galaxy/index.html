    <p>I spend a lot of my time in various corners of the graphics domain of the FOSS
world. In my time there I frequently have to deal with a variety of pixel
formats definitions. Every graphics API and project has its own way of
describing and naming pixel formats — the different flavors used by Vulkan,
OpenGL, Mesa, Gallium, Wayland, DRM, GBM, Pixman, Mir and SDL are just a few of
the beasts one can encounter in the graphics wilderness.</p>
<p>It could be my aging memory, but, for some reason, I never seem to be able to
remember how to interpret all the different formats. &quot;How are the components
laid out in memory?&quot;, &quot;Does it matter if the system is little-endian or
big-endian?&quot; are some of the questions I often have to look up, with varying
degrees of success.</p>
<p>It turns out that I am not the only one facing this issue. It's not uncommon
for developers to misinterpret pixel formats, often with entertaining and
psychedelic effects. If you are lucky you may catch a glimpse of uncanny blue
foxes running under alien red skies.</p>
<p>Despite the potential for entertainment, this problem is a constant cause of
frustration for developers. I finally decided to do something about it — I have
started the Pixel Format Guide.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://afrantzis.github.io/pixel-format-guide/">Pixel Format Guide</a>
consists of two components. The first is the guide itself — a collection of
documents describing how to interpret the pixel format definitions of various
APIs and projects.</p>
<p>The second component is the <a href="https://github.com/afrantzis/pixel-format-guide">pfg
tool</a> which performs the
interpretation of pixel formats automatically. Did you ever wonder how the
GL_RGBA with GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV <a href="https://afrantzis.github.io/pixel-format-guide/opengl.html">OpenGL pixel
format</a> is laid out
in memory?  Now it's easy to figure it out:</p>
<div class="nowrap">
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">$ python3 -m pfg describe GL_RGBA+GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV
Format:               GL_RGBA+GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV
Described as:         Native 32-bit type
Native type:          M                              L
                      AABBBBBBBBBBGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRR
Memory little-endian: 0        1        2        3
                      M      L M      L M      L M      L
                      RRRRRRRR GGGGGGRR BBBBGGGG AABBBBBB
Memory big-endian:    0        1        2        3
                      M      L M      L M      L M      L
                      AABBBBBB BBBBGGGG GGGGGGRR RRRRRRRR
</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>How about the WL_DRM_FORMAT_ARGB8888 <a href="https://afrantzis.github.io/pixel-format-guide/wayland_drm.html">Wayland-DRM
format</a>?
Again, it's easy:</p>
<div class="nowrap">
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">$ python3 -m pfg describe WL_DRM_FORMAT_ARGB8888
Format: WL_DRM_FORMAT_ARGB8888
Described as: Bytes in memory
Memory little-endian: 0        1        2        3
                      M      L M      L M      L M      L
                      BBBBBBBB GGGGGGGG RRRRRRRR AAAAAAAA
Memory big-endian:    0        1        2        3
                      M      L M      L M      L M      L
                      BBBBBBBB GGGGGGGG RRRRRRRR AAAAAAAA
</span></code></pre>

<p>The Pixel Format Guide is a work in progress. It currently supports many
Vulkan, OpenGL and Wayland(-DRM) formats, and it's constantly growing. This
project was conceived as a collaborative endeavor, not a one-person effort (but
I'll do my best), so, if you are familiar with a pixel format family, please
consider contributing to the guide and the python tool!</p>
<p>Before signing off I would like to thank my employer,
<a href="https://www.collabora.com">Collabora</a>, for sponsoring my work on the Pixel
Format Guide as an R&amp;D project.</p>
